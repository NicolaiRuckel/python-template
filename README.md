Python packaging can be confusing because there are [a][borini] [lot][yeaw]
[of][bernat] [different][smith] opinions and [loose standards][pep518].

This is a template for a Python project following all the current best
practices. Since there is not just one way to do those things in Python this
is also kind of opinionated but I tried to reduce this to a minimum.

This template is configured for Python versions 3.6 and above.

## Getting Started

To use this template for your project, do the following:

1. Update the `[tool.poetry]` section of the `pyproject.toml` with your and you
   package’s information.
2. If you want to use another license, change `COPYING` file and `license`
   section in `pyproject.toml`. You may consider changing the filename of
   `COPYING` if you do not want to use GPL according to the licence’s
   [guidelines][so-licences].
3. Rename `src/sample_package` to `src/$YOURPROJECT` and edit
   `src/$YOURPROJECT/__init__.py` accordingly.

## Poetry Quickstart

[Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) is used to build the package. After
installing Poetry, you can install this package with:

    poetry install

Poetry handles all the dependencies and virtual environments for you. To run
your code from and in your virtual environment prepend `poetry run` to your
command. By default, Poetry creates the virtual environments in it’s own
directory.

Since a lot of other tools expect your virtual environments in the project
directory itself as `.venv` the configuration in `poetry.toml` tells Poetry to
do exactly that. If you don’t want this or prefer another name for your virtual
environment (please don’t), you have to remove/adjust the following lines
in `poetry.toml`:

    in-project = true
    path = ".venv"

You can add dependencies with `poetry [-D] add $DEPENDENCY_NAME`, where `-D`
specifies development dependencies, e.g. libraries you need to build and
develop the code that don’t need to be shipped for end users. I advise you to
take a look at the [Poetry documentation][poetry documentation]

## Tests

This template contains a minimal [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
configuration for testing the project with Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8. Tests are
run in the CI but you can also run them manually with:

    poetry run tox

## Code Formatting

The source code is formatted with [Black][black].
To format your contributions manually, run

    poetry run black src

All code is also automatically checked in the CI.

## Continuous Integration

CI should work out of the box with the provided configurations in
`.github/workflow`. There is an action to check the code style and one to run
the tests.
